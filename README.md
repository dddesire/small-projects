madLibs: i suposse it's like a madlibs(not gonna lie don't even know what is this) where you input a file and the script reads it, finds any ADVERB, VERB, ADJECTIVE or things like this and then ask for inputs for each one found, them it creates a new file with the text in the one before but with the inputs insteads of the english thingies. assignement
